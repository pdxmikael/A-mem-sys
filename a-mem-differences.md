**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/llm_controller.py`

## 2. Memory System Improvements

### 2.1 Session Management
**Feature**: Added session-based memory segregation for better organization and isolation.

**Changes**:
- New `session_id` parameter in `AgenticMemorySystem.__init__()`

- New `_load_session_memories()` method to load existing memories for a session

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`

### 2.2 Status Callback System
**Feature**: Added real-time status updates during memory operations.

**Changes**:
- New `status_callback` parameter in `AgenticMemorySystem.__init__()`

- Configurable duration for status display

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`

### 2.3 Enhanced Memory Consolidation
**Feature**: Improved memory consolidation with better rules and feedback.

**Changes**:
- Updated consolidation rules with specific similarity thresholds (0.8 for strong, 0.6 for weak)
- Enhanced consolidation prompt with clearer instructions
- Better metadata merging during consolidation (keywords, tags from both memories)
- Consolidation completion status updates

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`

### 2.4 Backend-Agnostic Evolution Processing
**Feature**: Refactored evolution processing to work with different LLM backends.

**Changes**:
- New `_get_evolution_schema()` method to generate backend-appropriate JSON schemas
- New `_process_evolution_response()` method for backend-agnostic response processing
- Support for OpenAI's strict mode JSON schema requirements
- Better handling of consolidation responses across different backends

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`

### 2.5 Improved Search Functionality
**Feature**: Enhanced search with better filtering and exact match prioritization.

**Changes**:
- Session-based filtering in `search_agentic()` method
- Exact match prioritization with adjusted scoring
- Better result processing and deduplication

**Feature**: Improved error handling throughout the memory system.

**Changes**:
- Better exception handling in `analyze_content()` method
- Graceful fallback to default values when LLM analysis fails
- Enhanced error logging with more context
- Status updates for failed operations

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`

## 3. Retriever System Improvements

### 3.1 Persistent Storage
**Feature**: Added persistent storage for ChromaDB with improved error handling.

**Changes**:
- New `persist_directory` parameter in `ChromaRetriever.__init__()`
- Persistent client initialization with fallback mechanism
- Automatic corruption detection and recovery
- Enhanced document addition with better metadata processing

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/retrievers.py`

### 3.2 Improved Metadata Handling
**Feature**: Better metadata serialization and deserialization.

**Changes**:
- Enhanced metadata processing in `add_document()` method
- Improved metadata conversion in `search()` method
- Better handling of lists, dicts, and numeric values in metadata

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/retrievers.py`

### 3.3 Simplified Embedding Approach
**Feature**: Removed dependency on SentenceTransformer embedding functions.

**Changes**:
- Removed `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingFunction` import
- Removed enhanced document content creation (context, keywords, tags embedding)
- Simplified document addition process

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/retrievers.py`

## 4. Code Quality Improvements

### 4.1 Reduced Debug Output
**Feature**: Removed excessive debug print statements for cleaner operation.

**Changes**:
- Eliminated debug print statements throughout the codebase
- Replaced with proper logging and status callbacks
- Cleaner console output during normal operation

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`
- `agentic_memory/retrievers.py`

### 4.2 Better Code Organization
**Feature**: Improved code structure and modularity.

**Changes**:
- Extracted evolution schema generation to separate method
- Extracted evolution response processing to separate method
- Better separation of concerns in memory processing logic

**Files Affected**: 
- `agentic_memory/memory_system.py`
